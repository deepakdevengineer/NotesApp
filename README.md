NoteApp is a Java-based note-taking application that provides user authentication using Firebase Authentication and stores note data using Firebase Firestore. This allows users to securely create, manage, update, and delete notes, along with a personalized and colorful note-taking experience.

## Features

- **Firebase Authentication:** User authentication is handled using Firebase Authentication, allowing new users to create an account with their email and password. Returning users can log in using their registered email and password, ensuring a safe and streamlined login process.

- **Firebase Firestore:** NoteApp utilizes Firebase Firestore, a cloud-based NoSQL database, to store user data and notes. This ensures data persistence and synchronization across multiple devices.

- **Note Management:** Once logged in, users can create, view, update, and delete notes. This functionality allows users to keep their thoughts organized and accessible.

- **Colorful Notes:** Users can personalize their notes with different colors, making the note-taking experience more visually appealing and enjoyable.
